## Reflection

 A small side project to practice API handling. The app server fetches random words that are statically created in the app, retrieves their definitions from the Rapidapi API, and constructs a response containing word-definition pairs.
 These are then mapped into cards along with logic to create a word/definition mathcing game.

 Definitely made me more comfortable with API handling, but no where near where I would like to be. I plan on making another application that revolves around server-side functionality.
